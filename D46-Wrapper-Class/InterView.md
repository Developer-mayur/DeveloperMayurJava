 @Wrapper Classes
Each Primitive data type has a class defined for it, which wraps the primitive datatype into
object of that class. Wrapper classes provide lots of utility methods to operate on primitive
data values. As the wrapper classes enable primitive types to convert into reference types,
these can be used with collections too.
