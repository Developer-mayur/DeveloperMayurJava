#                                 Abstraction
#        Abstraction helps to move the focus from the internal details of the concrete
#        implementation to the type and its behaviour. Abstraction is all about hiding details about
#        the data, its internal representation and implementation.
#        The other related object oriented concept is encapsulation, which could be used to abstract
#        the complexities and the internal implementation of a class.
#        Abstraction also helps making the software maintainable, secure and provides an ability to
#        change implementation without breaking any client.
