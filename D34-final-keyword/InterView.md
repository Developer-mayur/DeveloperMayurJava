#                                       final  keyword
#                 final Class
#    final class cannot be extended, which makes the class secure and efficient.
#    final Method
#    final method cannot be overridden, which prevents any possibility of introducing any
#    unexpected behaviour to the class.
#    final Variable
#    final variable reference cannot be changed, but the content of the mutable object, that the
#    final variable is referencing, can be changed.
#    blank final variable - variable which is not initialized at the point of declaration.
#    Notes
#    blank final variable needs to be initialized in the constructor of the class.
#    final variables are like immutable variables, so computations related to final variables
#    can be cached for optimization.
