Q.16 Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements.


Q.17 Write a Java program to find duplicate values in an array of string values.




Q1. Find the majority element in array.

(A majority element in an array is an element that appears more than n/2 times where n is the size of the array.)


Q2.Java Program To Find Two Elements whose Sum is Closest to Zero.
( Two elements in a given array of positive  and negative numbers such that their sum is close to zero.)
for example- taking array   {-2,-1,3,6,5}
output:  -2 and 3


Q3.  To check the number is facinating number or not. 
(A fascinating number is a number that, when multiplied by 2 and 3, 
results in a concatenation of the original number and its products (in any order), 
containing all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. For example, the number 192 is a fascinating number because:
192 * 1 = 192
192 * 2 = 384
192 * 3 = 576
Concatenating the results: 192384576 contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.)


Q4. Permutation of string.

    
Q5. WAP To  Convert a String to an Integer .
