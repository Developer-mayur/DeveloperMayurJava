Q18. Find the majority element in array.

(A majority element in an array is an element that appears more than n/2 times where n is the size of the array.)


Q19.Java Program To Find Two Elements whose Sum is Closest to Zero.
( Two elements in a given array of positive  and negative numbers such that their sum is close to zero.)
for example- taking array   {-2,-1,3,6,5}
output:  -2 and 3


Q20.  To check the number is facinating number or not. 
(A fascinating number is a number that, when multiplied by 2 and 3, 
results in a concatenation of the original number and its products (in any order), containing all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. For example, the number 192 is a fascinating number because:
192 * 1 = 192
192 * 2 = 384
192 * 3 = 576
Concatenating the results: 192384576 contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.)
