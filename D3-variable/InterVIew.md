#                               Camel Case vs Pascal Case
#           Camel Case is practice of writing composite words such that the first letter in each word is
#           capitalized, like BorderLength; it is also known as Pascal Case or Upper Camel Case. But
#           in programming world, Camel case generally starts with the lower case letter, like
#           borderLength; it is also known as Lower Camel Case. For this discussion, letâ€™s consider
#           the format BorderLength as Pascal Case and the format borderLength as Camel Case.
#           Naming Convention
#           Naming convention is a set of rules that govern the naming for the identifiers representing
#           interface, class, method, variables, and other entities. Choice and implementation of
#           naming conventions often becomes matter of debate.
#           Standard naming convention improves the code readability, which helps in review and
#           overall understanding of the code.


#                                           Interface
#                                Name should be Pascal Case.
#                Name should be an adjective if it defines behaviour, otherwise noun.
#                public interface Runnable


#                                           Class
#                             Name should be Pascal Case.
#                             Name should be a noun, as a class represents some real world object.
#                             public class ArrayList
             

#                                          Method
#                                Name should be Camel Case.
#                                public boolean isEmpty()


#                                       Variable
#                             Name should be Camel Case.
#                             private long serialVersion = 1234L;


#                                      Constants
#                     Name should be all uppercase letters. Compound words should be separated by
#                     underscores.
#                     private int DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10;


#                                         Enum
#                          Enum set name should be all uppercase letters.
#                          public enum Duration {
#                          SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR
#                          }


#                                       Acronyms
#                Even though acronyms are generally represented by all Upper Case letters, but in
#                Java only the first letter of acronyms should be upper case and rest lower case.
#                public void parseXml(){}
